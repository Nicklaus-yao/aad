                    <h3>Origin Story</h3>
                    <p>The ZZ Plant is native to Eastern Africa, specifically the regions of Kenya, Tanzania, and Zanzibar. This resilient plant has evolved to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments, making it exceptionally well-suited for indoor cultivation. In its natural habitat, it grows in rocky, well-draining soil and can withstand long periods without water. Its ability to store water in its rhizomes and stems has made it a favorite among both beginners and experienced plant enthusiasts who appreciate its low-maintenance nature.</p>

                <div class="plant-features">
                    <h3>Unique Features</h3>
                    <p>The ZZ Plant is known for its glossy, dark green leaves that grow in a graceful, arching pattern. Each leaf is composed of multiple leaflets arranged along a central stem, creating a feather-like appearance. The plant has a slow but steady growth habit, with new stems emerging from underground rhizomes. One of its most remarkable features is its ability to store water in its thick stems and rhizomes, allowing it to survive extended periods of drought. The leaves have a natural waxy coating that helps them retain moisture and gives them their characteristic shine.</p>

                            <h4>Why are my ZZ Plant leaves turning yellow?</h4>
                            <p>Yellow leaves typically indicate overwatering. ZZ Plants are drought-tolerant and prefer to dry out between waterings. Reduce watering frequency and ensure the pot has proper drainage. Remove yellow leaves to maintain plant health.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>How do I propagate my ZZ Plant?</h4>
                            <p>ZZ Plants can be propagated through division or leaf cuttings. For division, separate the rhizomes during repotting. For leaf cuttings, remove a healthy leaf with its stem, let it callous for a day, then plant in well-draining soil. Keep the soil slightly moist until new growth appears.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Why is my ZZ Plant not growing?</h4>
                            <p>ZZ Plants are naturally slow growers. If growth has completely stopped, check for proper light conditions and ensure you're not overwatering. During winter months, growth may slow down further. Patience is key with this plant.</p>
