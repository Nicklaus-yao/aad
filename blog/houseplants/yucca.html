                    <p>The Yucca plant is native to the arid regions of Mexico and Central America, where it thrives in hot, dry conditions. These striking plants have become popular houseplants due to their dramatic appearance and low-maintenance nature. While they're often called "Yucca," they're also known as "Spineless Yucca" or "Giant Yucca" due to their size and lack of sharp spines. The plant's ability to adapt to indoor conditions and its architectural form have made it a favorite among plant enthusiasts. Their popularity has grown in recent years, making them a sought-after addition to modern interior design.</p>

The leaves are typically dark green and can grow up to 3 feet long. One of their most striking features is their ability to grow quite tall indoors, reaching heights of 6-8 feet in optimal conditions. The plant's dramatic form and architectural presence make it a perfect focal point in any room, adding a touch of desert elegance to your indoor space.</p>

                            <h4>Why are my Yucca leaves turning yellow?</h4>
                            <p>Yellow leaves typically indicate overwatering or insufficient light. Reduce watering frequency and ensure the plant receives bright, direct light. Also check that the soil is well-draining and that the plant is not sitting in water.</p>

                            <h4>How do I prune my Yucca plant?</h4>
                            <p>Prune your Yucca by cutting back the trunk to your desired height. New growth will emerge from the cut point. Always use clean, sharp tools and make the cut at a 45-degree angle. You can also remove any dead or damaged leaves at the base of the plant.</p>

                            <h4>Why is my Yucca not growing?</h4>
                            <p>Slow growth can be caused by insufficient light, overwatering, or lack of nutrients. Ensure your plant receives bright, direct light, allow the soil to dry between waterings, and fertilize during the growing season. Yucca plants naturally grow slowly, so be patient!</p>
