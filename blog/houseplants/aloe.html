                    <p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Aloe Vera</p>
                    <p><strong>Scientific Name:</strong> Aloe barbadensis miller</p>

                    <h3>Origin Story</h3>
                    <p>Aloe Vera is native to the Arabian Peninsula but has been cultivated worldwide for thousands of years. This remarkable plant has been used medicinally since ancient times, with records of its healing properties dating back to ancient Egypt. The plant's name comes from the Arabic word "alloeh" meaning "shining bitter substance," referring to its gel-like sap. Throughout history, Aloe Vera has been revered for its medicinal properties, earning it the nickname "plant of immortality" in ancient Egypt. Today, it's not only valued for its healing properties but also as a popular houseplant due to its striking appearance and low-maintenance nature.</p>

                <div class="plant-features">
                    <h3>Unique Features</h3>
                    <p>Aloe Vera is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that grow from a central stem. The leaves are typically green to gray-green in color, with serrated edges and small white spots. Each leaf contains a clear, gel-like substance that has been used for centuries for its medicinal properties. The plant can grow up to 2-3 feet tall and wide when mature, though it typically stays smaller indoors. In optimal conditions, Aloe Vera produces tall flower spikes with tubular yellow or orange flowers. The plant's ability to store water in its leaves makes it highly drought-tolerant, while its architectural form adds a sculptural element to any space.</p>

                            <h4>Why are my Aloe Vera leaves turning brown?</h4>
                            <p>Brown leaves typically indicate overwatering or too much direct sunlight. Aloe Vera prefers to dry out between waterings and should be protected from intense afternoon sun. Adjust your watering schedule and move the plant to a location with bright, indirect light.</p>

                            <h4>How do I harvest Aloe Vera gel?</h4>
                            <p>To harvest gel, select a mature leaf and cut it close to the base. Let the yellow sap drain out, then slice the leaf lengthwise and scoop out the clear gel. Use immediately or store in the refrigerator. Always leave enough leaves on the plant to maintain its health.</p>

                            <h4>Why is my Aloe Vera not growing?</h4>
                            <p>Slow growth is normal for Aloe Vera, but if it's not growing at all, check these factors: insufficient light, overwatering, or poor soil drainage. Ensure the plant receives bright, indirect light and is planted in a well-draining soil mix. Fertilize sparingly during the growing season.</p>
