                    <p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Jade Plant</p>
                    <p><strong>Scientific Name:</strong> Crassula ovata</p>

                    <h3>Origin Story</h3>
                    <p>The Jade Plant is native to South Africa and Mozambique, where it grows as a small tree in rocky, arid regions. This resilient succulent has been cultivated for centuries and holds special significance in many cultures. In Chinese culture, it's known as the "Money Plant" or "Friendship Tree" and is believed to bring good luck and prosperity. The plant's ability to thrive with minimal care and its longevity have made it a popular housewarming gift and a staple in homes and offices worldwide. Its name comes from the jade-green color of its leaves, which can develop red edges when exposed to bright light.</p>

                <div class="plant-features">
                    <h3>Unique Features</h3>
                    <p>The Jade Plant is characterized by its thick, woody stems and fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that grow in opposite pairs. The leaves are typically jade green but can develop red edges when exposed to bright light or during periods of stress. The plant grows in a tree-like form, with a thick trunk and branching stems that can reach up to 3 feet tall indoors. In optimal conditions, mature plants produce small, star-shaped white or pink flowers in winter. The plant's ability to store water in its leaves and stems makes it highly drought-tolerant, while its bonsai-like appearance adds an architectural element to any space.</p>

                            <h4>Why are my Jade Plant leaves falling off?</h4>
                            <p>Leaf drop typically indicates overwatering or sudden changes in environment. Jade Plants prefer to dry out between waterings and should be kept in stable conditions. Reduce watering frequency and ensure the plant is not exposed to drafts or temperature fluctuations.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>How do I encourage my Jade Plant to flower?</h4>
                            <p>Flowering occurs in mature plants during winter. To encourage flowering, provide bright light, cooler temperatures (50-55°F at night), and reduce watering. However, flowering is not guaranteed and may not occur every year.</p>

                            <h4>Why are my Jade Plant leaves turning red?</h4>
                            <p>Red edges on leaves are a natural response to bright light or stress. While this coloring is attractive and not harmful, if you prefer green leaves, move the plant to a location with less direct sunlight. The red coloring will fade over time.</p>
