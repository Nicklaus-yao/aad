                            <h4>Why are my Song of India leaves turning brown?</h4>
                            <p>Brown leaf tips typically indicate underwatering or low humidity. Increase humidity levels and ensure consistent watering. Also check for fluoride in your water, as this plant is sensitive to it. Consider using filtered or distilled water.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>How do I encourage more variegation in my Song of India?</h4>
                            <p>To maintain or increase variegation, provide bright, indirect light. Too little light can cause the plant to revert to solid green. However, avoid direct sunlight as it can scorch the leaves. Rotate the plant regularly to ensure even light exposure.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Why is my Song of India losing its lower leaves?</h4>
                            <p>Lower leaf loss is normal as the plant grows taller, but excessive leaf drop can indicate overwatering or poor drainage. Check that your pot has drainage holes and that you're allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Also ensure the plant is not exposed to cold drafts.</p>
