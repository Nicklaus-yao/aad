                    <p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Pilea, Chinese Money Plant</p>
                    <p><strong>Scientific Name:</strong> Pilea peperomioides</p>
                </div>
                <div class="plant-story">
                    <h3>Origin Story</h3>
                    <p>The Pilea is native to the Yunnan Province in China, where it grows in the understory of forests. This popular houseplant gained worldwide fame when a Norwegian missionary brought it back from China in the 1940s. While it's often called "Chinese Money Plant," it's also known as "Pancake Plant" or "UFO Plant" due to its distinctive round leaves. The plant's ability to adapt to indoor conditions and its unique appearance have made it a favorite among plant enthusiasts. Its popularity surged in recent years, making it one of the most sought-after houseplants in modern interior design.</p>

                <div class="plant-features">
                    <h3>Unique Features</h3>
                    <p>The Pilea is characterized by its round, pancake-shaped leaves that grow on long, thin stems. The leaves are typically bright green with a slight sheen, and they grow in a rosette pattern from a central stem. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit, typically reaching 12-18 inches in height. One of its most fascinating features is its ability to produce "pups" or baby plants that grow from the soil around the mother plant. These can be easily separated and propagated, making it a great plant for sharing with friends. The plant's unique form and easy propagation have made it a favorite among plant collectors.</p>

                            <h4>Why are my Pilea leaves curling?</h4>
                            <p>Curling leaves typically indicate underwatering or low humidity. Increase humidity levels and ensure consistent watering. Also check that your plant is not receiving too much direct sunlight, as this can cause leaf curl.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>How do I propagate my Pilea?</h4>
                            <p>Pileas are easily propagated through their "pups" or baby plants. When a pup has grown to about 2-3 inches tall, you can carefully separate it from the mother plant and pot it in its own container. Make sure to use well-draining soil and keep it slightly moist until established.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Why is my Pilea leaning to one side?</h4>
                            <p>Pileas naturally grow towards light sources. To maintain an even shape, rotate your plant regularly. If the leaning is severe, you can stake the plant or repot it at a more upright angle. The plant will naturally straighten as it grows.</p>
