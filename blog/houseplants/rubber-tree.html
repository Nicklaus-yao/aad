                <div class="plant-basics">
                    <p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Rubber Tree</p>
                    <p><strong>Scientific Name:</strong> Ficus elastica</p>
                </div>
                <div class="plant-story">
                    <h3>Origin Story</h3>
                    <p>The Rubber Tree is native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly India and Indonesia. This impressive plant was historically cultivated for its latex, which was used to make natural rubber. While commercial rubber production has largely moved to other species, the Rubber Tree remains a popular houseplant due to its striking appearance and air-purifying qualities. The plant's large, glossy leaves and tree-like form make it a favorite in interior design, while its ability to adapt to indoor conditions has made it a staple in homes and offices worldwide.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="plant-features">
                    <h3>Unique Features</h3>
                    <p>The Rubber Tree is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that emerge from a central stem. The leaves are typically deep green, though variegated varieties with cream or pink markings are also popular. The plant grows in an upright, tree-like form, with a thick trunk and branching stems that can reach up to 8 feet tall indoors. New leaves emerge from a protective sheath, unfurling in a striking red or pink color before maturing to their final shade. The plant's ability to grow large and its dramatic presence make it a perfect focal point in any room.</p>

                <div class="plant-popularity">
                    <h3>Why It's Popular</h3>
                    <p>The Rubber Tree has gained immense popularity as a houseplant due to its combination of beauty, adaptability, and air-purifying qualities. Its large, glossy leaves and architectural form make it a favorite in modern interior design, while its ability to thrive in various light conditions makes it perfect for different spaces. The plant's air-purifying abilities, as recognized by NASA's Clean Air Study, add to its appeal as a functional houseplant. Rubber Trees can live for decades with proper care, growing into impressive specimens that add a tropical touch to any indoor space.</p>

                            <h4>Why are my Rubber Tree leaves dropping?</h4>
                            <p>Leaf drop typically indicates overwatering, underwatering, or sudden changes in environment. Rubber Trees prefer consistent conditions and moderate watering. Check soil moisture and ensure the plant is not exposed to drafts or temperature fluctuations.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>How do I encourage branching in my Rubber Tree?</h4>
                            <p>To encourage branching, prune the top of the plant during the growing season. Make the cut just above a leaf node. This will stimulate new growth and create a bushier appearance. You can also try notching, which involves making small cuts in the stem above leaf nodes.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Why are my Rubber Tree leaves turning yellow?</h4>
                            <p>Yellow leaves usually indicate overwatering or poor drainage. Check that your pot has drainage holes and that you're allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Also ensure the plant is not sitting in water.</p>
