                <div class="plant-basics">
                    <p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Golden Pothos</p>
                    <p><strong>Scientific Name:</strong> Epipremnum aureum</p>
                </div>
                <div class="plant-story">
                    <h3>Origin Story</h3>
                    <p>The Golden Pothos is native to the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific, where it grows as a climbing vine in tropical rainforests. This versatile plant was introduced to the world of indoor gardening in the 1960s and quickly became a favorite due to its adaptability and striking appearance. Its ability to thrive in various conditions and its air-purifying qualities, as identified by NASA's Clean Air Study, have made it a staple in homes and offices worldwide. The plant's name comes from its golden-yellow variegation, which adds a touch of brightness to any space.</p>

                <div class="plant-features">
                    <h3>Unique Features</h3>
                    <p>The Golden Pothos is known for its heart-shaped leaves with distinctive golden-yellow variegation. The leaves can grow up to 12 inches long in optimal conditions, though they typically remain smaller indoors. The plant grows as a trailing vine, with stems that can reach impressive lengths of 20 feet or more. The variegation pattern varies from leaf to leaf, creating a unique and dynamic appearance. The plant's ability to grow in both soil and water makes it incredibly versatile, while its trailing habit allows for creative display options. The leaves have a glossy surface that helps them retain moisture and gives them their characteristic shine.</p>

                    <h3>Why It's Popular</h3>
                    <p>The Golden Pothos has gained immense popularity among plant enthusiasts due to its combination of beauty and ease of care. Its variegated leaves add visual interest to any space, while its ability to thrive in low-light conditions makes it adaptable to different home environments. The plant's fast growth rate and easy propagation make it perfect for beginners, as it quickly rewards care with new growth. Its trailing habit allows for creative display options, from hanging baskets to climbing moss poles. The Golden Pothos's ability to purify indoor air and its forgiving nature have made it a favorite in modern interior design.</p>

                            <h4>Why are my Golden Pothos leaves turning yellow?</h4>
                            <p>Yellow leaves typically indicate overwatering. Golden Pothos prefer to dry out between waterings. Reduce watering frequency and ensure the pot has proper drainage. Remove yellow leaves to maintain plant health.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>How do I encourage more variegation in my Golden Pothos?</h4>
                            <p>To encourage more golden variegation, provide bright, indirect light. The variegation is most pronounced in well-lit conditions. However, avoid direct sunlight, which can burn the leaves.</p>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h4>Can I grow Golden Pothos in water?</h4>
                            <p>Yes! Golden Pothos can thrive in water. Simply place stem cuttings in a container of water, ensuring the nodes are submerged. Change the water weekly to prevent bacterial growth. This method is great for propagation and creating a unique display.</p>
