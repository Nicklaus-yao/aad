                            <h4>How do I water my Air Plant?</h4>
                            <p>There are two main methods: soaking and misting. For soaking, submerge your plant in water for 20-30 minutes once a week, then shake off excess water and allow to dry completely. For misting, spray the plant thoroughly 2-3 times per week. Always ensure the plant dries completely between waterings to prevent rot.</p>

                            <h4>Why is my Air Plant turning brown?</h4>
